# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided 

The pair testing for this project was managed in a randomized fashion as it was the first time that the team was working together. This approach allowed for a fair distribution of tasks and ensured that everyone had an opportunity to work with different team members. In addition, teamwork and effort was divided as equitably as possible, with each team member being given the opportunity to work on tasks that they specialized in and felt most comfortable with. This approach ensured that everyone had the opportunity to utilize their strengths and contribute to the project in a meaningful way. To ensure that the pair testing was conducted effectively, the team established clear protocols and guidelines for testing and reporting results, which helped to streamline the process and ensure consistency. Furthermore, the team held regular meetings to discuss progress, share feedback, and make any necessary adjustments to the testing strategy. To facilitate continuous communication, the team also utilized an online group chat that allowed team members to voice their thoughts and ask questions, as well as have discussions on any matters that required attention. This helped to ensure that everyone was on the same page and any issues were addressed in a timely manner, which contributed to the overall success of the project. Overall, the team's approach to pair testing, division of effort, and communication was well-coordinated, efficient, and effective, which helped to ensure that the project was completed successfully.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

Within the course of the assignment, it was initially confusing due to the unfamiliarity of working with a new group of people and a program that required experimentation to learn, presented a number of difficulties and challenges. One of the main difficulties encountered was not knowing anyone in the group and trying to establish effective communication and collaboration. Additionally, working with a program that none of us were familiar with, proved to be a challenge as it required a lot of experimentation and trial and error to learn how to use it effectively. Another challenge was not knowing how to use JIRA, which is a tool that was integral to the project, but required additional learning and effort to master. Despite these difficulties, the team was able to overcome them through persistence, communication, and a willingness to learn and experiment. Ultimately, this assignment taught us valuable lessons about the importance of effective communication, the benefits of experimentation and learning, and the power of persistence in the face of challenges.

# Comments/feedback on the lab and lab document itself

The lab in question was found to be quite effective as an ice breaker for the team, as it provided an opportunity for team members to work together for the first time and get to know one another. The lab itself was well-designed, providing an appropriate level of complexity and engagement for the group. The simplicity of the lab allowed for everyone to understand the task at hand and work together effectively, however, it also provided enough work to keep everyone occupied and engaged throughout the duration of the lab, even though it could be considered tedious, but it was also engaging.
One of the main challenges encountered during the lab was the use of JIRA. Due to the lack of prior knowledge and understanding of the purpose and functionality of JIRA, the team initially struggled to navigate and utilize the tool effectively. This presented a significant challenge for the team, as JIRA was an integral part of the project, and its proper use was crucial to the success of the lab. Despite this, the team was able to overcome this challenge through persistence, communication, and a willingness to learn and experiment.
In terms of the lab document itself, it provided clear instructions and guidelines for conducting the lab, and was well-organized and easy to follow. However, the team did mention that they found it hard to understand the purpose of JIRA without any prior knowledge or understanding.
Overall, the lab was a positive experience for the team and provided a valuable opportunity for team members to work together and learn from one another. The challenges encountered during the lab served as valuable learning experiences that helped to strengthen the team's ability to work together effectively.
