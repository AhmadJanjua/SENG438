# 1 Introduction

In this lab, we were tasked with creating and implementing unit tests designed using white-box testing. In doing so, we learned about measuring the adequacy of our previous test suite from Lab 2 by measuring different coverage metrics. To accomplish this, we began by familiarizing ourselves with different testing tools, while trying to analyze our previous test suites on the statement, branch, and condition coverage. After this, we measured out data flow coverage manually by selecting two methods from org.jfree.data, and calculated their DU-pair coverage by tracing through their execution. We proceeded to design new unit tests to test DataUtilities and Range classes, with a goal of achieving a minimum of 90% statement coverage, 70% branch coverage, and 60% condition coverage. During this phase of the lab, we created a test plan and kept each test case in a separate method.
