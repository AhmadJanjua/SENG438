**# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed**
The team work was divided as much as possible to the best of our abilities. Due to how there were five tests from either Range or DataUtiltiltes, one different person had to do two tests such that all of the tests were done. Although work was not perfectly divided, it was done voluntarily and was not an issue amongst all the members of the team. The team used an online group chat to maintain constant communication throughout the project. This allowed team members to share their ideas and ask questions, as well as hold discussions on any important topics that needed attention. The chat helped keep everyone informed and on the same page, and quickly addressed any issues that arose. The team's method of combining division of tasks, and effective communication was well organised, efficient, and successful, leading to the successful completion of the project.

**# 6 Comments/feedback on the lab itself**
As participants of the lab, we found that it was well-designed and provided us with clear expectations of what was expected from us. The lab was not only educational, but also enjoyable and engaging, allowing us to learn about mocking and testing strategies through hands-on experience. The instructions were straightforward and easy to follow, making it much better than the previous lab we had done. We feel that this lab was a valuable opportunity for us to gain a deeper understanding of these crucial topics in software development. We came away from the lab feeling more confident and equipped to tackle these challenges in our future projects. As participants of the lab, we were thrilled to have the opportunity to work with JUnit and put our testing and mocking skills to the test. It was a great experience to get hands-on with this software, as we don't often have the opportunity to use it in our day-to-day work.
