# Introduction

In this lab, we were tasked with creating and implementing test cases based off of requirements outlined in Javadocs. Once we designed the cases for our selected methods, we implemented them in Eclipse. This lab taught us the basics of Eclipse, specifically using JAR files and JUnit testing together. As well, it familiarised us with creating partitions and equivalence class for our test cases.

# Detailed description of unit test strategy

Our main strategy used for unit testing was the black box testing method. In black box testing the idea is that the inner workings are hidden from us and that it is our job to explore and learn a lot of the functionality of this software by running test cases. To do this, we first needed to understand how the Range and DataUtilities classes operated and how the methods within these classes played a role in the overall testing. Once we were able to establish this, then we could move onto deciding which methods we wanted to test out of the total methods found in each of the classes we were evaluating. We then applied some black box testing methods and created specific strategies for each of the tests such as how we used boundary checking for many of the ranged class methods.

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed
The team work was divided as much as possible to the best of our abilities. Due to how there were five tests from either Range or DataUtiltiltes, one different person had to do two tests such that all of the tests were done. Although work was not perfectly divided, it was done voluntarily and was not an issue amongst all the members of the team. The team used an online group chat to maintain constant communication throughout the project. This allowed team members to share their ideas and ask questions, as well as hold discussions on any important topics that needed attention. The chat helped keep everyone informed and on the same page, and quickly addressed any issues that arose. The team's method of combining division of tasks, and effective communication was well organised, efficient, and successful, leading to the successful completion of the project.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

Some difficulties encountered were related to identifying scope,  isolation, generating mocks and the merging on Git. The first difficulty encountered was during the planning phase. Before writing test cases we had to determine if the tests were adequate coverage and did not go over scope. This posed the challenge to determine a well balanced scope. To solve this problem ECT and boundary testing was incorporated. For numerical tests we ensured the boundaries of the domain were covered and by using equivalent classes we minimised the net size of the test cases. The lesson learned from this is to utilise the techniques available as tools to create an adequate test suite with capabilities to test much of the program’s functional scope.
The second issue encountered was isolating each method. The challenge was to test a single method in isolation from the rest of the code. This was difficult because the implementation details were unknown, so it was difficult to determine if the method was truly isolated. To deal with this challenge mocking was used. Mocking made it so that functionality being outsourced to other methods was controlled, thus improving isolation. However, some methods rely on calling methods internally and without implementation details it was hard to determine the extent of isolation. The lesson learned was that mocking can to some degree aid in isolating the test to a specific unit of test.
Another issue encountered was merging to Github. The challenge was the merges would conflict and create issues in the merging process. The way to deal with the conflicts was to ensure that each person ensures their branch is up to date with main, then before sending a pull request monitoring the state to ensure compatibility. The lesson learned was to have communication and planning beforehand to ensure the merges would have minimal conflicts.
The final challenge that was encountered was using JMock. Much of the functionality and the way to create certain instances of mocks was challenging to determine. The gaps in knowledge of what mocks could do was challenging. In order to overcome this challenge the documentation, random examples and targeted questions were researched to determine how to use JMocks. The team also collaborated and shared findings about mocks to accelerate learning. Lesson learned is how to explore and learn new tools.


# Comments/feedback on the lab itself
As participants of the lab, we found that it was well-designed and provided us with clear expectations of what was expected from us. The lab was not only educational, but also enjoyable and engaging, allowing us to learn about mocking and testing strategies through hands-on experience. The instructions were straightforward and easy to follow, making it much better than the previous lab we had done. We feel that this lab was a valuable opportunity for us to gain a deeper understanding of these crucial topics in software development. We came away from the lab feeling more confident and equipped to tackle these challenges in our future projects. As participants of the lab, we were thrilled to have the opportunity to work with JUnit and put our testing and mocking skills to the test. It was a great experience to get hands-on with this software, as we don't often have the opportunity to use it in our day-to-day work.
